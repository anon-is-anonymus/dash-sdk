-----------------

## Overview
**dConstruct d.ASH SDK** is a cross-platform library for autonomous robot navigation. Use the d.ASH SDK to develop applications for your own Spot from Boston Dynamics or any other robot you wish. 

> :pushpin: For more information on the d.ASH SDK documentation, please refer to the [latest documentation release](https://dconstruct-tech.github.io/dash-sdk/).

## Whatâ€™s included in the SDK:
| What | Description |
| ------- | ------- |
| **[d.ASH Server](https://dconstruct-tech.github.io/dash-sdk/#dash-server)** | The d.ASH server acts as the main server responsible for sending control commands to the robot. At the same time, the d.ASH server also broadcasts secured data to any given remote systems.|
| **[d.ASH Autonomy Engine](https://dconstruct-tech.github.io/dash-sdk/#ros-driver)** | The d.ASH Autonomy Engine is the autonomy backend code that runs on the edge of the robot. It empowers the robot with robust multi-terrain (indoor and outdoor) autonomous navigation capabilities. It handles secure communication between automony engine and the remote autonomy controller. |
| **[d.ASH Autonomy Controller](https://dconstruct-tech.github.io/dash-sdk/#dash-autonomy-controller)** | The d.ASH autonomy controller is the GUI (graphical user interface) for the d.ASH autonomy engine. It enable users to monitor and have full remote control of autonomy by allowing users to plot waypoints and activate autonomy on a fleet of robots. Stream real-time data via a secure connection between robots and the controller using 4G or 5G. |

## Ready to Test!
There are two mission scripts available for general-purpose task execution and manipulation. Execute these mission scripts sequentially to control your Spot in any way you like. There are a total of 5 different types of missions:
1. [Clear Mission](/clear-mission)
2. Pause
3. Capture
4. End Waypoint
5. Move to Point

#### Clear Mission
The function `clearmission()` allows users to clear all previous missions in history.

#### Pause
The function `pause(int)` allows users to stop Spot from walking and pause for (int) number of seconds.

#### Capture
The function `capture(int)` allows users to capture an image using their camera ID.

#### End Waypoint
The function `endWayPoint()` allows users to send and follow a series of waypoints defined before `endWaypoint()` is called.

#### Move to Point
The function `moveToPoint(float, float, float)` allows users to move to a specified point `(x, y, z)` using a global planner.
